# Binary Search Tree

###The application implements a binary search tree of words in C++ and linkedlist


The application will start by reading all the words in a dictionary file that has been
provided. The file is not a complete dictionary. It simply contains all the
correct spelling for specific words in alphabetic order. The dictionary words will be
the basis for a custom binary search tree in the application.

The application uses a programmatic means to balance the binary search tree.
Once the binary search tree has been filled and balanced, the application will 
read in a second file that is a sample document needing spell checking. All the 
words in the document needing checking are located in the dictionary (and now 
in the binary search tree). It will then compare each word in the document against 
the binary search tree. If the search fails, you will display the misspelled word 
to the console.
